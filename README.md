# Readelf
### DESCRIPTION :
Readelf displays information about one or more ELF format object
files.  The options control what particular information to
display.

Elf files... are the object files to be examined.  32-bit and
64-bit ELF files are supported, as are archives containing ELF
files.

This program performs a similar function to **objdump** but it goes
into more detail and it exists independently of the BFD library,
so if there is a bug in BFD then readelf will not be affected.
